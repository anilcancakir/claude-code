# /ac:auto

Away mode. It carries the run already going in this session to its end while the user is gone, takes the
recommended option wherever that run would ask, performs only the outward actions the user named, and ends at one
verdict written by a gate that did none of the work. With nothing running it starts a new run from the request.

Request: $ARGUMENTS

## Standing rules

These hold for the whole run, including after a compaction: a re-attached skill keeps only its first 5,000 tokens
(https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills.md), so every bound lives here and the procedure follows.

**Carry, never decline.** Pick the source at 0b and continue it where it is. Another flow being active is the
normal case, not a conflict: never refuse because of it, and for sources (a) to (d) never open a second run, a
second marker or a new branch. Only a marker owned by another session refuses (0a).

**No questions while away.** Do not call `AskUserQuestion`, and do not let a flow you carry call it either: the user
is gone, and a question asked anyway was the most common complaint about earlier runs. The plugin's away guard
denies the call while the marker lives (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/pretooluse-bash-guard.sh`). Where a flow would ask,
take the option it marks Recommended (a flow gate's default), apply it, and add one line under `## Decisions` in the
decisions file: `time | source | question | chosen option | why | not user-approved`. An `ac:plan` interview still
open locks its remaining nodes through its 3d Force-finalize, which the marker `note` triggers (1c).

**True blockers stop only their part.** A destructive or irreversible action, an outward action the user did not
name, a finding that the plan or roadmap is wrong, and a missing secret or credential are not decided for the user.
Add one line under `## Blocked` in the decisions file (`time | source | what | why blocked`), take the option
that stops only that part (leave the step unchecked and skip its dependents, keep a lane's bundle in its queue),
and continue every independent part. When nothing independent remains, the source has reached its end.

**Outward actions only when named.** The marker's `allowed_outward` (1c) lists what the user's words allowed, out
of `push`, `merge`, `pr`, `release` and `deploy`. Perform an outward action only when its value is listed, and only
after the gate: at Phase 4, or under a coordinator source at its Phase 8, which publishes in place of `Push?`. No
other flow publishes while away: `ac:commit` skips its push under this marker. The same guard enforces the git and
gh verbs and always denies force pushes and remote deletes, `git reset --hard`, `git clean` outside a dry run,
whole-tree checkouts and restores, `rm -rf`, `sed -i` and `perl -i`; a deploy command is project-specific, so only
this rule keeps an unnamed one from running. A denied command is recorded under `## Blocked` as deferred, never worked around.

**Turn termination.** A turn ends on exactly one of: the Phase 4 closing report; a terminal branch that deleted
the marker first; or a one-line wait status while subagents or background work you started still run (each
notification starts the next turn; never wait with `sleep` or a polling loop). While the marker exists and the
verdict does not, the auto Stop guard (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/stop-guard-auto.sh`) blocks any other ending,
3 blocks per phase; over a coordinator run that run's own guard owns the stop until its marker is gone. Never end
a turn by describing what you would do next, and never hand the rest to a fresh session.

**Budgets are the user's.** A criteria file this skill writes carries `turn_budget` (default 40) and
`failure_budget` (default 0.2, a fraction of plan steps), or the numbers the user stated; never invent another.
Increment the marker's `turns_used` at each control point you regain. Reaching the turn budget, or failed steps
exceeding the failure budget, stops new work: record it under `## Blocked` and go to the gate. A coordinator
source carries no budgets of its own; its slot and attempt bounds are the bounds.

**A stop needs a name.** A part that cannot proceed names its class: a fact you cannot obtain, a decision only the
user can make, or a gate you cannot pass. Context pressure is none of them: compaction summarises and the run goes
on. When this procedure has been truncated away, re-invoke the `ac:auto` skill; 0a resumes from the marker.

**The user outranks everything.** A user asking to stop, pause or take back control: delete
`.ac/state/active-auto.json` and stop. A user saying they are leaving is the opposite request, and starts here.

**Files.** Mutate files with `Write` or `Edit`, never through `Bash` (`python3 -c`, a `cat >` heredoc, `sed -i`);
the one exception is removing a file with `Bash: rm -f <path>`. Per-turn prose is at most 3 lines plus the closing
report: every sentence in the chat is re-read on every later turn.

<role>
You carry one unattended run to its end. You pick the source, freeze what done means from it, keep it moving under
the rules above, hand the judgment to `ac:auto-verifier` once, and report. You do not judge your own run, you do
not rewrite the criteria after the work, and you do not decide a true blocker for the user.
</role>

<scope>
You write the marker `.ac/state/active-auto.json`, the decisions file `.ac/away/<slug>/decisions.md`, and for every
source but (a) the run directory `.ac/auto/<slug>/` with `criteria.md` and `verdict.md`; the shapes are in
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/criteria-schema.md`, which you read first. A coordinator run keeps its own
directory, criteria and verdict under `.ac/coord/<slug>/`. Everything else belongs to the flow you carry: plans to
`ac:plan`, `active-execution.json` and source code to `ac:execute` and its workers, `.ac/coord/` to
`ac:coordinate`. Under (d) the work in the conversation is yours to finish, as it was before the user left.
</scope>

## Phase 0: Re-entry and source

### 0a. Re-entry

Read `.ac/state/active-auto.json` if it exists:

- **Owned by this session** (`session_id` equals `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`): a re-entry, from a compaction, the
  Stop guard's latch note or a second `/ac:auto` (whose new arguments only add to `allowed_outward`). Skip to the
  marker's `phase`, reading its `note`. `executing` invokes nothing while the source still runs in context (its
  own marker exists, or under (d) the work is unfinished); once it has ended, refresh the marker to `gating` and
  go to Phase 3.
- **Owned by another session**: when its `started_at` is past the hooks' age bound (24 hours, 72 with
  `source: coordinate`), every hook already treats it as dead: overwrite it at 1c and log one `## Decisions` line
  naming the stale slug, because refusing would strand a user who has already left. Otherwise refuse in one line
  naming its slug: a live run in another window and an abandoned one look the same, so do not delete it.
- **Absent**: continue.

### 0b. Pick the source

Take the first match, in this order, so the most specific running flow wins:

| Source | Evidence | Criteria | Continue with | Branch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (a) coordinate | `.ac/state/active-coordinate.json` owned by this session | its `.ac/coord/<slug>/criteria.md`, frozen at its `Roadmap?` lock | the coordinator run, from its `state.json` | current |
| (b) execute | `.ac/state/active-execution.json` owned by this session | the plan, 1b | the run in context; invoke nothing | current |
| (c) plan | an `ac:plan` run in this conversation: a checkpoint, a review in flight, or a written plan with an unchecked step and no `report.md` | the plan, 1b | Phase 2 | current |
| (d) ad-hoc | unfinished work in the conversation, none of the above | the conversation goal, 1b | the work, in context | current |
| (e) new | nothing above unfinished; the arguments name a task | the request, through admission (1a) | `ac:plan --auto` | `auto/<slug>` |

A marker of either kind owned by another session is that session's run: it is not a source, and (a) or (b) does
not match on it. When the conversation's work is already complete and the arguments name no new task, there is
nothing to carry: end on a closing report of what is done, with no marker and no run directory.

## Phase 1: Freeze

### 1a. Slug, allowed outward, admission

- **Slug**: the coordinator slug under (a), the plan slug under (b) and (c), otherwise kebab-case from the goal or
  request, at most 6 words. Outside (a), when `.ac/auto/<slug>/` exists append `-2`, then `-3`.
- **`allowed_outward`**: the values the user's words name, read from the `/ac:auto` arguments and from the source
  run's own request (the coordinator's request, the plan's request, the conversation's ask), in any language:
  "push" allows `push`; "PR" or "pull request" allows `pr` and `push`; a release or tag allows `release`; "merge
  edip deploy et" allows `merge` and `deploy`. Then add what a named action needs to land: `merge` adds `push`, and
  `pr` too when the repository merges through pull requests (otherwise the merge is a local `git merge` into the
  base branch followed by a push of it); `deploy` adds `push` when the deploy is push-triggered (a workflow that
  runs on a push to the base branch). A negated or deferred mention ("don't push yet", "push etme") grants
  nothing, and nothing named means an empty list; never infer a value from what would be convenient.
- **Admission, source (e) only.** Draft the `must_haves` and `criteria` blocks in full first. A request whose done
  cannot be stated before the work exists ("clean up the codebase", "make it faster" with no number) is refused in
  at most 5 lines naming the criteria that could not be enumerated and the alternative (an audit run that produces
  criteria, then a run against them). Nothing is written before this test passes.

### 1b. Run directory, criteria and digest

Under (a) skip this step: the coordinator froze its criteria at its lock with this same digest. Otherwise create
`.ac/auto/<slug>/` first, because the Stop guard and the question-timeout hook both treat a marker without its
directory as malformed and go inert. Then `Write` `criteria.md` in the schema's exact shape with
`criteria_sha256: "pending"`, from the source:

- **(b) and (c), a plan file**: copy every `### Definition of Done` item and every step's `Done when` command
  verbatim, one criterion each, with `anchor: "<plan path>:<line>"` and `adopted_from: execute` or `plan`. A shell
  command becomes `verification: command` with the exit code its wording states (a "prints nothing" `rg` passes on
  exit 1); prose becomes `judgment`. Do not merge, reword, narrow or drop one: copied text with its anchor is what
  shows a criterion predates the work. When (c) is still an interview, write the directory and the marker now and
  `criteria.md` as soon as the plan file exists, before its first wave runs.
- **(d)**: the conversation's goal written as the request, `adopted_from: adhoc`; the gate caps it at
  `human_needed`, because the session that did part of the work also wrote what done means.
- **(e)**: the admission draft from 1a.

Budgets per the Standing rule. Then compute the digest over the frontmatter minus its own line and patch that one
line with `Edit`. Use this recipe as written, because `ac:auto-verifier` and `ac:coordinate` recompute with the
identical bytes and the detail implementations disagree on is a trailing newline:

```bash
python3 - .ac/auto/<slug>/criteria.md <<'PY'
import hashlib, sys
lines = open(sys.argv[1], encoding='utf-8').read().split('\n')
start = lines.index('---')
end = lines.index('---', start + 1)
covered = [l for l in lines[start + 1:end] if not l.startswith('criteria_sha256:')]
print(hashlib.sha256('\n'.join(covered).encode('utf-8')).hexdigest())
PY
```

No `python3` is a gate you cannot pass: delete what you wrote and stop, since an improvised digest is one the gate
cannot reproduce. From here the frontmatter is the contract and is never edited; prose below the delimiter is free.

### 1c. Marker and decisions file

`Write` `.ac/state/active-auto.json` with the schema's fields: `slug`, `session_id` (exactly
`${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`, which scopes every guard to this session), `started_at` (`date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`,
never refreshed), `turns_used: 0`, `phase` (`planning` for (c) and (e) before a plan exists, otherwise
`executing`), `source` (`coordinate`, `execute`, `plan`, `adhoc` or `new`), `source_ref` (the coordinator or plan
slug, omitted for (d) and (e)), `allowed_outward`, `decisions: ".ac/away/<slug>/decisions.md"`, and a `note`
that starts `away: no questions; plan questions lock through 3d Force-finalize.` so `ac:plan` asks nothing.

Then `Write` the decisions file:

```markdown
# Away run <slug>

Source: <source> <source_ref>. Allowed outward: <values, or none>.

## Decisions

## Blocked
```

Add each line at the end of its section with `Edit`. Refresh `turns_used`, `phase` and `note` at every control point.

### 1d. Branch, source (e) only

`Bash: git switch -c auto/<slug>` (append `-2` when taken). Uncommitted changes follow the switch; do not stash or
commit them. A failed switch is a terminal branch. Every other source stays on the branch it is on: its commits are
already there, and a switch mid-run would split one run's history across two branches.

One heartbeat line: the source, the slug, the budgets, `allowed_outward`.

## Phase 2: Carry the source

The flow you carry keeps its own procedure; these rules ride on top of it, and where its body says to ask, the
Standing rules say what happens instead.

- **(a) coordinate.** Continue from `state.json` at the marker's phase; when its body is no longer in context,
  re-invoke `ac:coordinate`, whose Phase 0 resumes an owned run. A `Roadmap?`, `TDD?` or bundle decision takes its
  Recommended option. `Lane block?`, `Conflict?`, `Relock?` and `Add bundle?` are true blockers: record them, keep
  the bundle in `owner_queue`, and keep dispatching and integrating the rest. Its Phase 7 is this run's gate, and
  its `Push?` is not asked: unless its verdict is `gaps_found`, apply `Push + PR` when `allowed_outward` holds
  `pr` or `merge`, `Push` when it holds only `push`; otherwise `Keep local`, the push recorded as deferred. Its
  Phase 8 close follows, then Phase 4 here for whatever remains (a merge, a deploy).
- **(b) execute.** Never invoke `ac:execute`: its 1e rewrites `active-execution.json` and its failure history lives
  in context, so a second invocation restarts the wave loop with that history lost. It keeps `AUTO_MODE` once your
  marker appears, and its final commit goes `--no-push` because the marker exists.
- **(c) plan.** A checkpoint: `Skill: skill "ac:plan", args "--auto <checkpoint slug>"`, the slug verbatim and never
  the topic, because `ac:plan` re-derives the slug from its argument and a topic can miss the checkpoint. A plan whose
  reviewer is still running: wait for it and continue the plan's own flow; never adopt a plan before its review
  lands. A written plan nobody executed: `Skill: skill "ac:execute", args "<slug> --auto"`, the one invocation of
  execute this skill makes, because no plan run exists to chain it.
- **(d) ad-hoc.** Finish the work in context under the project's working rules, against the frozen criteria.
- **(e) new.** `Skill: skill "ac:plan", args "--auto <request>"`; its Stage 6a chains `ac:execute`, so never invoke
  execute yourself.

When the source reaches its terminal state (its report or verdict written, its marker gone, or no independent part
left), refresh the marker to `phase: "gating"`.

## Phase 3: Gate

Under (a) the coordinator's Phase 7 already ran the gate; go to Phase 4. Otherwise recompute the digest with the
1b recipe and compare it to `criteria_sha256`. A mismatch means the contract changed after it was fixed: delete
the marker, name the mismatch and stop rather than gate against a file of unknown provenance. A decision taken
while away that diverges from a criterion is one line of prose below the delimiter, never a frontmatter edit.

```
Agent({
  subagent_type: "ac:auto-verifier",
  description: "Away-run verdict",
  prompt: "Criteria: <absolute path>/.ac/auto/<slug>/criteria.md
Schema: ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/criteria-schema.md"
})
```

Two absolute paths and nothing else: your account of the run would replace the evidence the gate gathers. `Write`
the returned body verbatim to `.ac/auto/<slug>/verdict.md`; that write releases the Stop guard whatever the verdict
says. An unusable body gets one re-spawn; a second one is written as `status: human_needed` with one line naming
what the gate did, never `passed`. A verdict reporting gaps is a complete ending: never go back to make it pass.

## Phase 4: Outward actions and close

1. **Outward actions.** Each value in `allowed_outward` the run has not already performed: `push` pushes the
   current branch (`git push -u origin <branch>`), `pr` opens one (`gh pr create`, a body free of em and en
   dashes), `merge` merges that PR (`gh pr merge`), or in a repository without pull requests merges locally into the base
   branch and pushes it, `release` cuts the release the request named, `deploy` runs the
   deploy the request or the project's docs name (none found is a missing fact, recorded under `## Blocked`). On a
   `gaps_found` verdict none runs: each is recorded as deferred, because publishing work the gate found unmet is
   the user's call. Report each command's result.
2. **Close.** Delete `.ac/state/active-auto.json` and the Stop guard's counter `stop-guard-auto.json` in the run
   directory (`.ac/auto/<slug>/`, or `.ac/coord/<slug>/` under (a)), so the next run starts with a fresh budget.
3. **Report.** What finished (steps or bundles, the branch and its head); the verdict's `status`, criteria met
   against total, each gap in one line and the verdict path; every line under `## Decisions`, one each; every line
   under `## Blocked`, deferred outward actions included; what was pushed, merged or deployed. A
   `proposed_overrides` entry stays a suggestion until the user answers it; only their answer fills `accepted_by`.

## Terminal branches

Each deletes `.ac/state/active-auto.json`, and the counter when one exists, before it stops.

| Ending | Where |
|---|---|
| Verdict written and Phase 4 done | Phase 4 |
| The user asked to stop, pause or take back control | anywhere |
| Digest mismatch, no `python3`, a failed branch switch, a source that aborted before its gate | Phase 1 to 3 |

A refusal at 0a or 1a, and a (d) whose work was already complete, wrote nothing, so they leave nothing to clean up.

<reminders>
- Carry the running flow; never decline because of it and never open a second run beside it.
- No questions while away: Recommended option, one decisions line; true blockers go under `## Blocked`.
- Outward actions only from `allowed_outward`, only after the gate, none on `gaps_found`.
- One gate, against criteria frozen before the work; a verdict with gaps is a complete ending.
- Every ending deletes the marker first.
</reminders>
